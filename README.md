# kinnovis_challenge

This is a chellenge from Kinnovis Team. First of all thanks for your tasks. It was interesting for me =)

How to use it ?

You have 2 ways just choose one for better performance:

1) Clone the project via git clone command. Then use `npm i` to install all dependecies. 
Then `npm run serve` to start the project locally. 

2) Use the link https://master.d3iod18fz2d1yc.amplifyapp.com/ to just use the application. Its is hosted to the AWS Amplify service and uses all its features as well

Please note. 
Project is using AWS for database and API. For the contract it have a GraphQL connection.
Because its not fully setted up project (I suppose thats you didnt asked and also its what I cant show you, because its in personal AWS area) and have a vulnerability in git -> this hosting and project will dissapear from AWS in 20 days.

The descriptions of each tasks is in Issues folder in git and you can get first one by the link https://github.com/ataztech910/kinnovis_challenge/issues/1 and second one by the link https://github.com/ataztech910/kinnovis_challenge/issues/2

Have fun =)
